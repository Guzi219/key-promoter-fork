Key Promoter Plugin (Fork)
==========================

This is a fork of the Key Promoter plugin for IntelliJ Idea. The original source code can be found at https://code.google.com/p/key-promoter/


Additional Features / Modifications
-----------------------------------
* Statistics are persisted and thereby not deleted when closing the IDE.
* The file used is $HOME\keypromoterstats.csv. Further statistics can be obtained from this file, e.g. which shortcuts you do not use
the most. Thereby, it is more obvious which shortcut combinations are worth learning for you to increase your personal efficiency.
